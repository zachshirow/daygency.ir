## Our approach to website creation

You could use a million software out there to make the website you want and each have their own pros and cons. What we specialize in is creating static websites using [Astro Js](https://astro.build/), and [React Js](https://react.dev/). We then author the content of the website using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

What we're good at is making static websites that prioritize content and speed. Our own website uses the same tech stack and as you can see it is quite fast. 

We will make a website with the same statistics and modify it to suit your needs.
